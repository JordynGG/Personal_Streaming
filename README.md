# Personal_Streaming
Analyze and develop a recommendation model using preliminary Spotify data capturing feature based recommendations opposed to current recommendation algorithm to enhance general user experience through the classification clustering of song attributes to create playlists that stimulate brain (e.g. Tone, Tempo, Volume)

# Data
Outlining to develop our model on
variables including Genres, Artist, and
System interaction we are confident in
our ability to transform and translate our
project into every user's favorite song.
Size:
● 12.4 MB
● 169,220 Objects
● 22 columns
Genres:
Trap, Techno, Techhouse, Trance,
Psytrance, Dark Trap, Hardstyle,
Underground Rap, Trap Metal, Emo, Rap,
RnB, Pop, Hiphop and more.

# User playlists are curated for a variety of reasons, only a few of these reasons require the genres of the songs.
These reasons include:
● General feeling that user is trying to convey
● Playlists for a specific event or gathering
● Keeping track of songs that user enjoys
● Songs with specific BPM for workouts
The overall benefits of this model include but are not limited to:
● Automating parts of playlist creation to save time
● Commiting to greater efforts in leaving users more satisfied by using the platform and its services.
● Better help music listeners expand their music knowledge beyond genre

# Classification Clusters
Examined the song characteristics averaged out by genre in order to understand how
our algorithm is separating songs into playlists. (baseline to observe our clusters
against. )
We chose this specific dataset mostly due to the depth of information provided.
Basing recommendations off of technical music attributes would be best. After
searching through kaggle, we were able to find this dataset which included the genre
for each song. We decided this attribute would be important in our analysis when
comparing the success of our model hypothesis.
● Provide a deeper understanding of music and the role it plays in our daily live
